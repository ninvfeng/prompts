# FAQs

## Do I need to input a prompt every time?

In the API, you can set the prompt as a "system prompt" so that you don't have to input it again. ChatGPT will follow the instructions given in the system prompt.

In the web version of ChatGPT, if you haven't switched the main prompt, you can simply enclose the subsequent reply in quotation marks. This way, you don't need to input the prompt every time. However, if the generated reply doesn't align with the desired prompt, it means that ChatGPT has forgotten the prompt, and you will need to input it again to remind it. Furthermore, each conversation link is unique, so you can save commonly used conversations as bookmarks for future use.

## Outputting false information

Although ChatGPT is incredibly powerful, it is not infallible. Sometimes it may generate false information. For example, when I needed to input hundreds of pieces of information into AiShort, I instructed ChatGPT to convert the data into a specific format. However, during the conversion process, I noticed that some of the information was incorrectly written by ChatGPT. For instance, a tag in the text was "movie critic," but ChatGPT changed it to "film critic." While this might not have much impact in the text, it could cause errors when placed in code. Therefore, when using ChatGPT, it is crucial to check its output content.

## Prompts not working well

All prompts are sourced from the internet and are regularly updated. While I have tested each prompt, the actual performance may vary depending on the specific requirements. If you find any errors, have creative ideas, or have good prompts to contribute, please feel free to provide feedback and submissions [here](https://github.com/rockbenben/ChatGPT-Shortcut/discussions/11).

If you are summarizing or consolidating information, you can use GPT to further refine the original answer and improve its accuracy. Moreover, prompts can not only be used for productive tasks but also help broaden your thinking, stimulate creativity, approach problems from multiple angles, and address issues that are easily overlooked in conventional thinking.
